# 🌿 Welcome to AgriSphere — Where Innovation Meets the Soil 🌍

Hi there! We’re building **AgriSphere**, a smart irrigation and climate-resilient platform inspired by Kenya’s **Galana Kulalu Irrigation Project** — and designed for **global food security**.

---

## 🚀 What We’re Building

> A sustainable, scalable, and lovable platform for next-gen agriculture.

**🔐 Built With:**
- 🧠 Supabase — Auth, Realtime DB, Role-Based Dashboards
- ⚛️ Vite + React + TypeScript — Ultra-fast frontend
- 🎨 Styled Components — Lovable, accessible UI
- 🌤️ Climate-Aware Tools — Smart irrigation, crop yield forecasts
- 🌍 Role-based Access — Farmers, planners, researchers, admins

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

- ✅ Email/Password & OAuth Auth (Supabase)
- ✅ Realtime user dashboards (per role)
- ✅ Digital soil & irrigation dashboard
- ✅ Solar & IoT pump control logic (future goal)
- ✅ Smart alerts (drought, yield, water balance)

## 💡 Why This Matters

The world faces a growing food crisis — and climate change is shrinking the margin of error for farmers.

> AgriSphere is built to **make climate-resilient farming delightful and data-driven** — from Kenya to Kansas.
